## Project Purpose ✏️

Created just for fun and learning about Unity! This project helped me practice with prefabs, code-driven infinite object spawning, collision detection, scoring systems, and basic UI logic. 
Minimalist, copyright-free visuals allowed more time and focus on programming and coding skills.

No commercial intent—this was a personal study and experiment.

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open with Unity (2021 or newer recommended)
3. Run the main scene, flap, and see how far you can fly!
